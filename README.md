# Description
For my second exam on school I made a word guesser. You must first toss a coin, this determines whether you or the computer starts. Then you have to guess from the computer or the computer from you. By means of ASCII drawings you can see your progress. Whoever guesses the least times wins the game. You can play again afterwards if you want.
